{"id": 1569, "problem": "In 1993, a rancher had good record title to a 20-acre orange grove in fee simple absolute. In 1994, the rancher delivered to his son, for a sum of $1,000, a deed signed by the rancher, naming the son and his heirs as grantee, and appearing valid on its face. The son neglected to record the deed. In 1998, a farmer, aware of the existence of the rancher-to-son deed, sought out the rancher and asked to buy for $10,000 a deed to the orange grove from the rancher to the fanner and his heirs. The rancher executed such a deed, and the fanner promptly recorded it. The farmer's intent was to acquire color of title and obtain ownership of the orange grove by adverse possession. In 1998, the farmer constructed a fence around the orange grove. In 1999, the son presented his deed of the orange grove to a retiree, and for $15,000, paid by the retiree, signed and delivered a deed of the orange grove in favor of the retiree and his heirs. After receiving the deed, the retiree made no effort to search the title, to examine the property, or to record the deed. In 2003, a buyer paid the fanner $20,000, and the farmer delivered to the buyer a deed of the orange grove in favor of the buyer and his heirs. The buyer had examined the property, had searched the title, and had no knowledge of the farmer's awareness of the prior rancher-to-son instrument. Although the buyer did not reside on the property, he regularly visited the orange grove twice a week. The buyer recorded his deed. In 2007 for $25,000 paid by an orange grower, the retiree signed and delivered adeed of the orange grove naming the orange grower and his heirs as grantees. Before the grower had paid the retiree and taken his deed, the grower visited the orange grove and observed the fence. However, the buyer was not present when the grower visited the property and nothing suggested who \u0080\u0094if anyone \u0080\u0094was using it. In any case, the grower did not attempt to search the title before making his purchase. This jurisdiction uses Grantor \u0080\u0094Grantee Indices and has no Tract Index. In 2008, what is the present state of title to the orange grove if the jurisdiction's recording act provides: \"Every conveyance of real property shall be invalid as against any person, except the grantor, his heirs, and assigns, having actual notice thereof, unless it is recorded as provided by statute\"?\nA. In a notice jurisdiction, the grower, as a subsequent bonafide purchaser, is only chargeable with notice of what appears in his chain of title and, therefore, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nB. In a race \u0080\u0094notice jurisdiction, the farmer would acquire equitable title to the orange grove, because he erected the fence and failed to inform the buyer of the prior rancher-to-son instrument.\nC. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the farmer, having recorded his deed first, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nD. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the grower, being the last to record, would acquire record title to the orange grove.\nE. In a notice jurisdiction, the retiree would acquire record title to the orange grove even though he failed to record his deed.\nF. In a race-notice jurisdiction, the son would acquire record title to the orange grove, because he is the original grantee.\nG.

{"id": 2056, "problem": "When an adult mouse or bird is castrated, its sexual behavior virtually disappears. Compare the effects of castration of highly developed primates with the less developed animals.\nA. In higher primates such as man, castration does not affect the ability to perform the sexual act, provided the male is sexually mature and experienced.\nB. In primates, castration after sexual maturity reduces aggression but has no effect on sexual behavior.\nC. Primates show a temporary decline in sexual behavior post-castration, but it fully recovers within weeks.\nD. Castration in primates results in complete loss of sexual behavior\nE. Castration in primates has no effect on their sexual behavior at any stage of development.\nF. Castration of primates leads to an increase in sexual behavior due to hormonal imbalances.\nG. Castration affects the ability to perform sexual acts in all animals\nH. Primates can't learn sexual behavior through experience\nI. Castration of primates causes a permanent shift to non-sexual social behavior patterns.\nJ. In higher primates, castration before puberty prevents the development of sexual behavior entirely.", "answer": "A"}

Stereotyping is a fundamental aspect of attribution theory.\nF. Attribution theory suggests that stereotyping is always inaccurate.\nG. Attribution theory is a branch of the study of stereotyping.\nH. Attribution theory explains stereotyping as a form of social learning.\nI.

{"id": 2234, "problem": "What is higher-order (second-order)conditioning ?\nA. Higher-order conditioning is the process of extinguishing a conditioned response\nB. Higher-order conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus is paired directly with an unconditioned stimulus without the presence of a conditioned stimulus.\nC. Higher-order conditioning is based on secondary reinforcement. A neutral stimulus is paired with the conditioned stimulus after that conditioned stimulus can reliably elicit the conditioned response.\nD. Higher-order conditioning involves introducing a new unconditioned stimulus to alter an existing conditioned response.\nE. Higher-order conditioning is based on primary reinforcement\nF. Higher-order conditioning is when a conditioned response is transferred from one organism to another without conditioning the second organism.\nG. Higher-order conditioning is the simultaneous pairing of multiple conditioned stimuli with a single unconditioned stimulus to produce a stronger conditioned response.\nH. Higher-order conditioning involves pairing a stimulus with an unconditioned response\nI. Higher-order conditioning happens when a previously conditioned stimulus is used to reinforce a different behavior without any direct association to the original conditioned response.\nJ. Higher-order conditioning is a process where only unconditioned stimuli are used to create a conditioned response.", "answer": "C"}
